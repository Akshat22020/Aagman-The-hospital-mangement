# 🏥 Smart Hospital Queue Management System with AI Integration

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is our **Final Year B.Tech CSE Major Project**, developed by a team of four. It is designed to revolutionize the **hospital queue management system** by integrating **AI-driven automation** and **patient-centric healthcare services**.

The system provides patients with a **seamless way to search, book, and buy doctor appointment slots automatically**—reducing long waiting times, overcrowding, and inefficiencies in traditional hospital queues.

Additionally, we have incorporated an **AI-powered Mental Health Assistance Module** that provides users with basic conversational support, stress analysis, and self-care recommendations—bridging the gap between patients and mental wellness support.
